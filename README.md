# Overview
The Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples project focuses on evaluating the grammatical correctness of spoken sentences using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust and automated system that can analyze voice inputs and assign grammar scores, helping improve spoken language proficiency‚Äîespecially in educational or language learning settings.
This engine leverages features extracted from voice samples‚Äîsuch as acoustic signals, speech-to-text conversions, and linguistic markers‚Äîto evaluate grammar quality. The application is particularly useful for learners, educators, and assessment platforms aiming to automate spoken grammar evaluation.
